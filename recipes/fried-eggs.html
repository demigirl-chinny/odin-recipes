    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p><strong>Fried eggs are an easy breakfast idea which can be served with bread along side a cup of tea. 
        This is a quick fix breakfast that can be prepared in less than 10 minutes.
        I fry anything between 2 to 4 eggs at the same time depending on the number of persons and size of the frying pan.</strong></p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>

    <li>Fry for 5 minutes before spraying a pinch of salt (to taste), then about a half of seasoning cube (I prefer less)</li>
