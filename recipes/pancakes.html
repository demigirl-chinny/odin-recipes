    <h1>Pancakes Recipe</h1>
    <img src="../images/pancakes.jpg" alt="Pancakes dish">
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p><strong>They are really delicious and easy to make. You can enjoy them as a snack, or as breakfast</strong></p>
    <p>Pancakes are served as a snack with anyone of jam, honey, ketchup, butter or a blend of two</p>
    <p> I think the name "diet" suits it better because it is actually a blend of protein, carbohydrate, vitamins and fat and oil.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3> <em>servings:4</em>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cup of plain flour</li>
        <li>3 medium eggs</li>
        <li>Half cup of evaporated milk</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons of margarine</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon of salt</li>
        <li>Teaspoon ground red dried pepper
        <li>1 cup of water</li>
        <li>Vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 Spoon of thinly sliced onion (optional)</li>
        <li>3 Tablespoons of sugar</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Start by melting the margarine in a heated oven, use a ceramic plate, add two spoon of margarine and allow to melt under heat. You can also place the bowl in a bigger bowl of hot water to melt the margarine.</li>
        <li>Break the two eggs into the melted margarine and mix together. Transfer to a bigger bowl and add your liquid milk, pepper, salt, sugar, half cup of water and stir all together.</li>
        <li>Add the flour and mix well till there are minimal lumps, you can use a wooden turner for this, add more water, 100ml and observe, the batter should be watery enough to flow around the bowl. But not too watery.</li>
        <li>Add the thinly sliced one spoon of onions, stir all together and commence with the frying part.</li>
        <li>Set your frying pan over medium heat, non-stick frying pan makes perfect pancakes</li>
        <li>Add a few drops of vegetable oil, about a tablespoon, would do and make sure they are evenly spread to cover the surface of the pan.</li>
        <li>Allow to heat for few seconds and pour some pancake batter into the frying pan. Make sure they are evenly spread too, you don’t want your pancake to be too thick or too thin.</li>
        <li>Fry and flip the other side, one minute each for the sides. Check to see that it is properly cooked the way you like it.</li>
    </ol>
    <em>Repeat for the remaining batter and serve as a snack… with your favorite soft drink or as breakfast with tea or coffee. </em>
