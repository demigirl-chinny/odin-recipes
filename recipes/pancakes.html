    <h1>Pancakes Recipe</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p><strong>They are really delicious and easy to make. You can enjoy them as a snack, or as breakfast</strong></p>
    <p>Pancakes are served as a snack with anyone of jam, honey, ketchup, butter or a blend of two</p>
    <p> I think the name "diet" suits it better because it is actually a blend of protein, carbohydrate, vitamins and fat and oil.</p>
